# FMF
*　Noise detectors commonly face the problem of over-cleansing and high time complexity <br>
*　A fast noise detector that makes a multi-factor-based learning was proposed <br>
*　FMF removes the noisy instances which completely enter other classe <br>
*　Smoothing the decision boundary allows FMF to achieve a promising result <br>
*　FMF is considered capable of processing the large-scale datasets <br>
*　FMF is applicable to the problems that required to be taken care of timely <br>
