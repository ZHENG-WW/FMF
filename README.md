# FMF
Noise detectors commonly face the problem of over-cleansing and high time complexity
A fast noise detector that makes a multi-factor-based learning was proposed
FMF removes the noisy instances which completely enter other classe
Smoothing the decision boundary allows FMF to achieve a promising result
FMF is considered capable of processing the large-scale datasets
FMF is applicable to the problems that required to be taken care of timely
